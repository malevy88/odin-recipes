# odin-recipes

This exercise is the last project of the fundmentals on The Odin Project. Utilizing HTML, I was able to structure the pages using paragraphs,
breaks between lines, unordered lists and ordered lists. I also was able to use photos stored in a different folder and hyperlinks to link back
to the main page of the website.
